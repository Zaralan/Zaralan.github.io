      <p>Most of the build is set in stone and there are only a couple places to be creative with it, majority of which are inside of the Assassination tree.</p>
      <div id="talentsImage"><a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?talent#fhg00xxZMgVo0cxqru0xRt:hk0mcV" target="_blank" title="Click to go to the Talent Calculator"><img src="./Assets/Images/Build.jpg" alt="Combat Rogue 3.3.5a PVE Talents. Click to go to the Talent Calculator"/></a>
        <p>This is my build. It's pretty much the same as standart, but it may and should be changed based on your equipment and play style.</p>
      </div>
      <h2><a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=48668" target="_blank"><span class="mIcon Eviscerate"></span> Eviscerate</a> vs <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=48672" target="_blank"><span class="mIcon Rupture"></span> Rupture</a></h2>
      <p>Depending on your finisher, you can either play with <a  href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=14164" target="_blank">Improved Eviscerate 3/3</a> which will increase the damage of your <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=48668" target="_blank">Eviscerate</a> by 20%, or you may pick <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=51633" target="_blank">Blood Spatter 2/2</a> which will increase your <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=48672" target="_blank">Rupture</a> damage by 30% and leave you an extra tallent point to spend on <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=14156" target="_blank">Ruthlessness.</a></p>
      <p>Most of the guides will tell you to play with <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=48672" target="_blank">Rupture</a> in the low gear and <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=48668" target="_blank">Eviscerate</a> in the high gear when you'll have more ARP, because it will deal more damage and blah, blah, blah. It's a lie. After hours of testing I found out that even with full ARP cap <strong><a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=48672" target="_blank">Rupture</a> deals more damage than <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=48668" target="_blank">Eviscerate</a>.</strong> There are two reasons for that:
      <ol>
        <li><a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=48672" target="_blank">Rupture</a> is 10 energy cheaper, hence, every 4th use of this finisher allows you to hit one more time with the <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=48638" target="_blank">Sinister Strike</a> which is one of your main sources of damage.</li>
        <li><a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=48672" target="_blank">Rupture</a> deals additional 30% damage with Feral's or Arms' bleed buff which even without the <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=56801" target="_blank">Rupture glyph</a> deals more damage than <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=48668" target="_blank">Eviscerate</a> with <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=56802" target="_blank">the glyph.</a></li>
      </ol>
      </p>
      <p>If you want to maximize your DPS, you should use both: <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=14164" target="_blank">Eviscerate 3/3</a> with <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=56802" target="_blank">the glyph</a> and <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=51633" target="_blank">Rutrure 2/2</a> without <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=56801" target="_blank">the glyph</a>. Then ommit <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=14156" target="_blank">Ruthlessness</a> at all, it's not that profitable as may seem. However, <strong>I still play with <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=14164" target="_blank">Improved Eviscerate 3/3</a> only.</strong> But why?</p>
      <p>Playing with both finishers requires more effort and and it will increase your DPS for sure, but very slightly. Finisher mooves are in the last lines of your recount. This small increase is simply not worth the effort. This information is still here just in case you want to go absolutely tryhard and squeeze out of your class as much DPS as you only can.</p>
      <h2><a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=16513" target="_blank"><span class="mIcon VilePoisons"></span> Vile Poisons</a> vs <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=14117" target="_blank"><span class="mIcon InstantPosion"></span> Improved Poisons</a></h2>
      <p>After picking your finisher and learning <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=14137" target="_blank">Lethality 5/5</a> which is must have, you are left with 5 more points to spend in Assasination tree. The best way to spend them is to enhance your poisons, that are one of your main sources of damage too. <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=16513" target="_blank">Vile Poisons</a> will increase the damage of your poisons, whereas <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=14117" target="_blank">Improved Poisons</a> will increase the amount of procs of those poisons.</p>
      <p>Most people learn <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=16513" target="_blank">Vile Posions</a> for 1/3 and spend the rest in the <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=14117" target="_blank">Improved Poisons</a>, which is not bad, but I'd reccomend to ommit <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=16513" target="_blank">Vile Poisons</a> completely and take <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=14117" target="_blank">Improved Poisons</a> 5/5. It'll allow your Deadly Poison stack faster which is very usefull in the beggining of the combat and after the change of. It allows you to hit the 5 Deadly Poison staks faster. It also decreases the inner cooldown of your Instant Poison which will make it proc more often to. In general, fully caped <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=14117" target="_blank">Improved Poisons</a> will deal more damage than <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=16513" target="_blank">Vile Poisons</a> 1/3.</p>
      <p><strong>Spending more than 1 point into <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=16513" target="_blank">Vile Posions</a> is a mistake. It'll deal more damage, but the number of applies of your poisons will decrease drammatically.</strong></p>
      <h2><a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=13964" target="_blank"><span class="mIcon Swords"></span> Swords</a> vs <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=13807" target="_blank"><span class="mIcon Daggers"></span> Daggers</a></h2>
      <p>This part is dedicated to some varieties in Combat tree which aren't many, but still. You can change your weapon talents based on the weapons you use. I often see people with <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=13964" target="_blank">Hack and Slash 5/5</a> in their build who don't have good swords or axes yet so they wear daggers instead. Plese don't do it, it's waste of your skill points and DPS. Don't be afraid to change your build based on your weapons, it's not that expencive. <strong>Take <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=13807" target="_blank">Close Quarters Combat 5/5</a> if you use daggers or <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=13803" target="_blank">Mace Specialization 5/5</a> if you use maces.</strong> It will help.</p>

    <section id="glyphs">
      <h1 class="secIntro">Glyph Choices</h1>
      <div id="glyphsImage"><a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?talent#fhg00xxZMgVo0cxqru0xRt:hk0mcV" target="_blank" title="Click to go to the Talent Calculator"><img src="Assets/Images/Glyphs.jpg" alt="Combat Rogue 3.3.5a PVE Glyphs. Click to go to the Talent Calculator"/></a>
        <p>These are my glyphs. There are many like them, but these one are mine.</p>
      </div>
      <h2>Major</h2>
      <p>Your major glyphs will consist of:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?item=42972" target="_blank">Glyph of Sinister Strike</a> is essential to the Combat Rogue, since <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=48638" target="_blank">Sinister Strike</a> is your main and only Combo Point generator which you'll use during the whole fight.</li>
        <li><a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?item=42961" target="_blank">Glyph of Eviscerate</a> which you will never change despite the build you use, because there is nothing worse that non-criting <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=48668" target="_blank">Eviscerate</a>.</li>
        <li>The last major glyph if for the burst and you have one choice to make here:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h3><a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?item=42954" target="_blank"><span class="mIcon AdrenalinRush"></span> Adrenalin Rush</a> vs <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?item=45762" target="_blank"><span class="mIcon KillingSpree"></span> Killing Spree</a></h3>
            <p><a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?item=45762" target="_blank">Glyph of Killing Spree</a> is what most people take, because <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=51690" target="_blank">Killing Spree</a> deals so much damage in a short period of time which is good for burst and blah, blah, blah. But the true is, <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=51690" target="_blank">Killing Spree</a> is often not that usefull without <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=13877" target="_blank">Blade Flurry</a>. It may jump over the slime on the <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?npc=36627" target="_blank">Rotface</a>, or on the trash on the <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?npc=37813" target="_blank">Saurfang</a>, or on the one of the inactive princes before <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?npc=37955" target="_blank">Lana'thel</a>, or on the trash with Val'kyres on <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?npc=36597" target="_blank">The Lich King</a> and deal ablsolutely no effective damage. <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=13877" target="_blank">Blade Flurry</a> negates this aspect and allows your <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=51690" target="_blank">Killing Spree</a> to deal even more damage when there are many targets around you which will never be uneffective. Since <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=51690" target="_blank">Killing Spree</a> without <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?item=45762" target="_blank">the glyph</a> and <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=13877" target="_blank">Blade Flurry</a> have the same cooldoun, I see no reason to change it with <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?item=45762" target="_blank">the glyph</a>. I'm not even talking about the fact that it might just kill you in the fight with <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?npc=39863" target="_blank">Halion</a> on the second phase, which makes no sence to use <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=51690" target="_blank">Killing Spree</a> there, hence to decrease it's cooldound with glyph.</p>
            <p>That's why I use the <strong><a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?item=42954" target="_blank">Glyph of Adrenaline Rush</a></strong> which <strong>allows to decrease the downtime during the burst phase</strong> by givving you 5 more seconds of almost unlimited energy.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>Other major glyphs are almost useless.</strong></p>
      <h2>Minor</h2>
      <p>Minor glyphs are not as important, but I'll go over them too.
      <ol>
        <li><a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?item=43379" target="_blank">Glyph of Blurred Speed</a> is cool to have. Sometimes it helps to mount up in the water.</li>
        <li><a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?item=43378" target="_blank">Glyph of Safe Fall</a> will save your life a bunch of times.</li>
        <li><a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?item=43380" target="_blank">Glyph of Vanish</a> helps you to retreat faster in an unexpected situation.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>Other minor glyphs are almost useless.</strong></p>
